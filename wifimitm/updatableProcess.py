    Process capable of updating its state based on process' feedback.
    Feedback is considered stdout, stderr, exitcode in case of process' exit and other files created by running process.

    Temporary directory is created for process' feedback.

    Process' stdout and stderr are continuously written to files in the temporary directory. Stdout and stderr can be
    independently read using `self.stdout_r` and `self.stderr_r` file-like objects.

    Can be used as context manager, on exit from the context, the process is waited and then cleanup is performed.

    Process is started on initialization of the object. Running process should be stopped by `self.stop()` or
    `self.cleanup()` call. Call to `__del__` will stop the process, but `__del__` call is not guaranteed during
    destruction, see `Data model <https://docs.python.org/3.5/reference/datamodel.html>`_.

    On cleanup, finalizer call or `__del__` call, stdout and stderr file-like objects for reading and writing are
    closed, temporary directory and all its content is deleted.
