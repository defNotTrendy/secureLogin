# Decrypt Ninja LS v0.4.2

This is a Windows Based Application for a Spyware - NinjaLS - I developed for Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing purposes. This tool was built with information-privacy responsibility in mind and its meant to be used on machines that the attacker has permission to conduct penetration testing or any other forms of information security testing. I will not be held liable for any deviations and usage of this tool for criminal purposes. 

This framework utilizes the Windows Forms Framwork to receive encrypted data (Keystrokes, Mouse Clicks, User Activity) from the NinjaLS Spyware tool and curates them into a management tool where the attacker/penetration tester can sieve through the vast amount of data to get the interesting ones through search and clicking through tabs.

*This project is done while learning about SHA Salted Encryption Methods.*
